  <h4>The Rising Costs of Pregnancy Complications</h4>

  <p> After Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, families have to look at maternal healthcare differently, the healthcare expenses have increased tremendously from 2000 to 2021, this increase highlights systemic issues in the healthcare system. Pregnancy complications have devastating physical, emotional, and financial consequences for mothers, babies, and the healthcare system. </p>

  <p> Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, shows the increase in healthcare spending. This increases the pressure that families face when complications occur during pregnancy and influences the decisions on seeking medical care. Hypertension, diabetes, and hemorrhage pregnancy complications increased dramatically from 2000 to 2021. </p>

  <p> The cost increase represents the true cost of prescription drugs and healthcare services, as it accounts for the money refunded to payers. These figures are adjusted after payments made by pharmaceutical companies to health insurers, Medicaid, and Medicare.</p>


  <p> There are many types of pregnancy complications, such as premature births, where a baby is born before 37 weeks  and stillbirths, where a fetus dies in utero after 20 weeks. </p>

  <h4> Celebrity Examples</h4>

  <p> Many celebrities have opened up about their experience with pregnancy complications, to bring more awareness. <a href= "https://www.vogue.com/article/beyonce-september-issue-2018">Beyoncé</a> had complications in 2017 when she gave birth to her twins because she experienced preeclampsia, which involved high blood pressure, swelling, and organ damage. This combined with one of the twins' heartbeat pausing led to her having an emergency C-section. </p>

  <p> <a href= "https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/opinions/protect-mother-pregnancy-williams-opinion/index.html">Serena Williams</a> also had complications when she gave birth to her daughter in 2017 after a pulmonary embolism, when a blood clot travels to the lungs. Williams explained that when she expresssed feeling pain she was dismissed by healthcare providers, this delay nearly killed her.</p>

  <h4> Greater Risk for Black Women </h4>

  <p> Pregnancy complications in general affect people who give birth but Black women are disproportionately impacted. According to the <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/womens-health/features/maternal-mortality.html">CDC</a>, Black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy complications compared to white women. </p>

  <p> Other factors are income inequality, not having access to consistent prenatal care that would detect and manage complications early leads to late diagnoses. Racial discrimination in general and when expressing needs to health professionals and being ignored impacts stress levels. </p> 

  <h4> Economic Impact </h4>

  <p> The increasing number of pregnancy complications will also impact families and the healthcare system. Parents will also face a loss of income from taking time off work to recover from a difficult pregnancy.</p>

  <p> High costs can also lead to people avoid pregnancy in general due to potential complications and the expenses that come with it. This will lead families to choose between facing a lot of debt or decline necessary medical care, which will negatively impact the mother and baby. </p>

  <p> If the birth rate declines due to the increased prices, this will eventually lead to a smaller workforce as people retire and a new generation moves in with new ideas. There will be a lower demand in child services jobs which will affect the funding for these jobs.</p>

  <p> Economic inequality will grow, wealthier families will be able to afford children and low-income families will have to struggle. Consumer spending could decrease as families will have less disposable income, buying new products helps strengthen the economy. The housing market will decrease because if there aren't a lot of people who will need houses then construction will slow down. </p>

  <p> Letiana Kwizera, from Burundi but arrived to the United States in 1998, explained her birth experience when she had her daughter in 2000</p>

  <p>“I wasn’t worried about the price, I was worried about my life. Giving birth is very dangerous in Burundi, I wanted to make sure I would survive here.” Kwizera said. </p>


  <h4> Normal Pregnancy </h4>

  <p> As medical techniques on treating pregnancy complications increase. Normal pregnancy has also seen an increase when it comes to delivery and postpartum treatments. As the technology improves this also causes an increase and more medicine is introduced this is a factor to the price increase. </p>

  <p> While some pregnancy risks are preventable if caught early, the rising costs for normal pregnancy makes it harder for families to access the care they need.</p>

  <h4> Solutions </h4>

  <p> To address the rising costs with pregnancy complications solutions will need to be immediate and to have long term stability. Expanding access to prenatal care for low income women is needed. One possibility is better insurance coverage for pregnant women so they won’t have to face the costs of treatment for high risk pregnancies. </p>

  <p> For policies there is the <a href= "https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1234/text">Maternal CARE Act</a> that was proposed in 2018 by Vice President Kamala Harris and it included two grants. </p>

  <p> The Implicit Bias Training grants would provide funding to medical school, nursing schools, and obstetrics and gynecology training programs. The training involves addressing stereotypes associated with people and changing that behavior. The Pregnancy Medical Home Demonstration Project would provide a medical home that prioritizes pregnant and postpartum women who aren’t insured or qualify for Medicaid. </p>
